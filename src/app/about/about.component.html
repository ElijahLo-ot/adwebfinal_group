    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Gender equality aims to achieve genuine equality between men and women by planting the idea of respecting human rights deeply into society's soil. This can only be achieved when both genders are treated similarly and equally. Each individual of society dreams to have an equal rights and access to resources available at their disposal, but there is a lot if discrimination. This discrimination can be due to cultural, geographical differences, the colour of the person, social status and even gender. Gender inequality is the most prevalent discrimination. It is prevalent across the globe though it is not localize issue and is limited to only certain spheres of life. We can see many examples of gender bias, even in progressive societies.

    <p>The inequality in gender nowadays undermines people social structure by reducing the value of women. It is so alarming to know that people tend to devalue girls, females, woman by the world's unfair equal rights in terms of everything. Also, people actually wasting a tremendous human potential in the world and losing a lot of opportunity that may help our society to grow. Women are way more exposed to assault, threat or physical, verbal even digital attack than the men. This only prove that women only have fewer opportunities for economic involvement than their male counterparts. Thus, we would like to advocate the gender equality empowerment, for us to enable the full capabilities and opportunity for female or women around the world.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>    
    <p>
        Various countries, girls and women are discriminated in school because they know that the men are lot more capabilities when it comes of working after they. Their own family will only let their sons or males to attend school for they have the higher chance to be accepted in any kind of work that they wanted to be in, unlike on the women, will are very limited whenever, whatever, wherever they may in. Furthermore, women are being ignored when it comes in political, social leadership especially on decision making in political, economic and public life. And the other one is the unequal rights to economic resources, property ownership and financial services. This are just a few problems when talking about on gender equality.
    </p>
    <h5>Other issues of gender inequality of different countries around the globe:</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>1. The gender pay gap</h5><p>- Some statistics shows that women are paid less than 80 percent than men. At some other cases, women are also discriminated with racism and resulted of uneven or poor salaries payment for their work.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>2. Gender disparities in agriculture </h5><p>- Women have less access to important tools and resources such as fertilizer, seeds, training, and farm labor. Even when they have equal access to these resources, it does not always result in income equality. Women, as primary caregivers for children, face challenges in getting their goods to market, particularly in rural areas. Reduced harvests and access result in lower income, which is especially harmful so even though women tend to reinvest their income back into their families and communities. When women do not earn as much as men, everyone suffers. </p>
    <br>
    <h5>3. Lack of employment equality </h5><p>- The division of labor is one of the causes of gender inequality in the workplace. Most societies have an ingrained belief that men are simply better suited to certain jobs.
        Most of the time, those are the highest-paying jobs. Women's income is reduced as a result of this discrimination. Women also bear the primary responsibility for unpaid labor, so even when they work full-time, they have extra work that is never compensated financially. </p>
